Step 1: Set Up Your Telegram Bot 

If you haven't created a Telegram bot yet, follow these steps to create one and obtain an API token:<br>

Open Telegram and search for BotFather.<br>
Start a chat with BotFather, send the /newbot command, and follow the instructions to create your bot.<br>
BotFather will provide an API token after the setup is complete.

Step 2: Add the Bot to Your Channel

Add the bot you created to your Telegram channel as an administrator. You need it because the bot needs permissions to post messages.<br>
Go to your channel’s “Info” > “Administrators” > “Add Administrator”.<br>
Search for your bot by username and add it.<br>

Step 3: Install the pyTelegramBotAPI Library

pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
