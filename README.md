Step 1: Set Up Your Telegram Bot
If you haven't created a Telegram bot yet, follow these steps to create one and obtain an API token:

Open Telegram and search for BotFather.

Start a chat with BotFather, send the /newbot command, and follow the instructions to create your bot.

BotFather will provide an API token after the setup is complete.

Step 2: Add the Bot to Your Channel

Add the bot you created to your Telegram channel as an administrator. You need it because the bot needs permissions to post messages.

Go to your channel’s “Info” > “Administrators” > “Add Administrator”.

Search for your bot by username and add it.

Step 3: Install the pyTelegramBotAPI Library

pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
